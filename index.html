              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The landing page integrates a custom "Explore" element that follows the
                user's cursor, aimed at creating an immersive and interactive experience. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The mousemove event listener on the container captures the cursor's x and y
                coordinates using the event object (dets). By leveraging GSAP's to() method, the "Explore" element
                (moveCursor) is animated to follow the cursor's position in real-time. This creates a smooth and
                responsive interaction, enhancing user engagement by making the interface more dynamic and visually
                appealing, encouraging users to explore the website further.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> State Management and DOM Manipulation</h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The navigation bar's functionality relies heavily on direct DOM
                manipulation methods, such as document.querySelector, to control its visibility and styles. This
                approach can lead to inefficient updates and potential inconsistencies with React's virtual DOM,
                increasing the risk of performance issues and making the code harder to maintain. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Transition to a state-driven approach by utilizing React's useState hook to
                manage the navigation bar's visibility. This allows for conditional rendering and CSS class toggling
                based on the component's state, reducing reliance on direct DOM manipulation and aligning better with
                React's declarative nature.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Efficient State Management for Conditional Rendering in Login
                Page</h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The primary challenge in the login page component was managing the
                conditional rendering of the signup and login forms based on the user’s interaction. The state
                management needed to ensure a smooth transition between the two forms while maintaining clarity and
                usability for the user. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> To address this challenge, I implemented a state variable (state) using the
                useState hook to track the current form being displayed. By toggling the state upon button clicks, I
                enabled the seamless switching between the signup and login forms. This approach ensured that the forms
                were presented clearly and intuitively, enhancing the overall user experience.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Dynamic Canvas Rendering for Scratch-off Coupon Functionality
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The implementation of a scratch-off feature required direct DOM
                manipulation to draw on a canvas. Managing mouse events efficiently and ensuring that the canvas updates
                correctly based on user interactions posed a challenge, especially in ensuring the context remained
                clear and performant without performance issues. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The scratch functionality was implemented using the HTML5 canvas API, where
                event listeners were added to handle mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, and mouseleave). This
                enabled real-time drawing on the canvas, allowing users to 'scratch' off the overlay to reveal the
                coupon underneath. Proper cleanup of event listeners ensured there were no memory leaks.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Achieving Seamless 3D Effects in Staggered Image Animations
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> Creating a staggered animation for multiple images that fade in and out
                sequentially posed challenges in ensuring smooth transitions without overlap. Additionally, achieving a
                convincing 3D effect for the advertisement section required precise perspective manipulation and
                layering, aiming to simulate the illusion of girls emerging from the mobile screen to enhance user
                engagement effectively. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> To tackle this, I leveraged GSAP's timeline feature to animate the images
                using their references. This allowed me to orchestrate a staggered fade-in and fade-out sequence with
                precise control over timing and opacity, ensuring a smooth and repetitive animation cycle. Additionally,
                I applied CSS transformations like perspective, rotateY, and rotateX to the elements. The use of image
                references enhanced the depth of the 3D effect, making it appear as
                though the images were dynamically popping out of the screen, thus creating an engaging experience for
                users.

                Category Display
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The first challenge involved animating multiple images within each
                CategoryCard, ensuring smooth transitions as each image becomes visible one after another. Additionally,
                the second challenge was implementing vertical sliding functionality, allowing users to navigate through
                categories using up and down arrows, while maintaining fluid transitions and avoiding layout or overflow
                issues. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The sliding animation of multiple images in each CategoryCard is handled
                using CSS, where images are placed side by side in a flex container, and transitions are applied for
                smooth horizontal movement. the animation is handled by applying CSS transformations using translateX.
                The images maintain responsiveness with object-cover and are optimized by Next.js for quick loading and
                seamless transitions.
                For the next challenge The solution enables smooth vertical sliding by adjusting the scroll position
                using scrollTo and scrollTop. Clicking the arrow scrolls 20% of the viewport height, resetting to the
                top when reaching the bottom for a seamless loop.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Achieving Smooth Transitions and Neon Light Effects
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> Managing smooth transitions between different product groups in the Shop
                section, while also creating a heading that mimicked a neon signboard, posed significant challenges. The
                Shop section required handling a large number of product cards, dynamic image loading, and fluid
                animations, which complicated performance optimization. Simultaneously, achieving a realistic neon light
                effect for the heading involved precise control over color transitions, shadows, and timing to replicate
                the look of a neon sign turning on from "off." <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> I used Framer Motion to implement smooth transitions for both the product
                group navigation and the neon signboard animation. For the Shop section, Framer Motion’s ease-in-out
                transitions paired with Next.js image optimization ensured fluid interactions without performance loss.
                For the neon sign, I fine-tuned color and shadow effects to create an authentic lighting glow. These
                solutions improved both visual dynamics and performance, enhancing my ability to craft complex
                animations and optimize large UI components.

                transitions
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> Implementing an auto-scroll feature in the 'New Arrival' section while
                ensuring smooth transitions, responsive behavior, and uninterrupted user interaction presented a
                challenge. Achieving seamless, fluid scrolling across a wide range of product images required precise
                timing and control of both manual and automatic scrolling. Additionally, handling dynamic image loading
                efficiently without causing performance lags or visual glitches was critical for maintaining an optimal
                user experience.<br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> By leveraging the useRef hook in combination with the setInterval function, I
                created a responsive auto-scroll mechanism that resets based on user interaction. The scroll position
                was managed dynamically to ensure smooth transitions, while Next.js's image optimization handled image
                loading efficiently. This process enhanced my skills in managing dynamic scrolling behavior and
                optimizing image-heavy components for high performance.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Efficient Prop Management in React
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The primary challenge was managing the complexity of passing multiple
                props through several component layers in a React application. Specifically, I needed to efficiently
                pass various product-related data, such as images, descriptions, ratings, prices, and offers, from the
                top-level page.js component to the nested Trending.js and subsequently to the ProductCard.js component.
                This complexity could lead to potential issues with prop drilling and maintainability as the application
                scales.<br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> To address this challenge, I structured the data as a single object for each
                product within page.js, which included all necessary attributes. This approach minimized prop drilling
                by consolidating the product information into an easily manageable format. In Trending.js, I
                destructured the props and mapped them to individual ProductCard components, thereby ensuring a clean
                and efficient data flow. Additionally, I utilized PropTypes to validate the props in ProductCard.js,
                enhancing the robustness and maintainability of the component.

                product card outfits correspond to the background image, while handling user interactions effectively
                for a smooth user experience.<br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the current image
                index, dynamically rendering paired product cards that correspond to the changing background image. This
                synchronization ensures that the outfit displayed in the product card matches the outfit shown in the
                background. To enhance user engagement, mouse enter and leave event listeners were utilized to control
                the visibility of the quick buy section; it opens on hover and remains visible while the cursor is over
                it, closing only when the cursor leaves the quick buy div. Additionally, references were employed to
                manage opacity transitions, providing an intuitive interface that facilitates seamless interaction
                between different product displays and enhances the overall user experience.
