    <p class="para1">
      This website serves as a showcase for my <strong>Women Fashion Website</strong> project,
    <span class="para"> "This project is a visual exploration of a Women Fashion Website, emphasizing user interface
      design and animations. The focus is solely on creating a visually appealing and interactive experience on the
      frontend.
      While the project does not include backend integration or mobile responsiveness, it serves as a demonstration of
      advanced animation techniques and frontend styling." this site is built using Next.js.</span>
    Due to deployment challenges with the live version, I created this site to highlight the features, functionality,
    and design of the project, including GIFs, a video walkthrough, and detailed explanations of the key components.
