              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Enhancing User Engagement with Interactive Cursor Element</h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The landing page integrates a custom "Explore" element that follows the
                user's cursor, aimed at creating an immersive and interactive experience. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The mousemove event listener on the container captures the cursor's x and y
                coordinates using the event object (dets). By leveraging GSAP's to() method, the "Explore" element
                (moveCursor) is animated to follow the cursor's position in real-time. This creates a smooth and
                responsive interaction, enhancing user engagement by making the interface more dynamic and visually
                appealing, encouraging users to explore the website further.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> State Management and DOM Manipulation</h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The navigation bar's functionality relies heavily on direct DOM
                manipulation methods, such as document.querySelector, to control its visibility and styles. This
                approach can lead to inefficient updates and potential inconsistencies with React's virtual DOM,
                increasing the risk of performance issues and making the code harder to maintain. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Transition to a state-driven approach by utilizing React's useState hook to
                manage the navigation bar's visibility. This allows for conditional rendering and CSS class toggling
                based on the component's state, reducing reliance on direct DOM manipulation and aligning better with
                React's declarative nature.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Efficient State Management for Conditional Rendering in Login
                Page</h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The primary challenge in the login page component was managing the
                conditional rendering of the signup and login forms based on the userâ€™s interaction. The state
                management needed to ensure a smooth transition between the two forms while maintaining clarity and
                usability for the user. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> To address this challenge, I implemented a state variable (state) using the
                useState hook to track the current form being displayed. By toggling the state upon button clicks, I
                enabled the seamless switching between the signup and login forms. This approach ensured that the forms
                were presented clearly and intuitively, enhancing the overall user experience.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Dynamic Canvas Rendering for Scratch-off Coupon Functionality
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong> The implementation of a scratch-off feature required direct DOM
                manipulation to draw on a canvas. Managing mouse events efficiently and ensuring that the canvas updates
                correctly based on user interactions posed a challenge, especially in ensuring the context remained
                clear and performant without performance issues. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The scratch functionality was implemented using the HTML5 canvas API, where
                event listeners were added to handle mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, and mouseleave). This
                enabled real-time drawing on the canvas, allowing users to 'scratch' off the overlay to reveal the
                coupon underneath. Proper cleanup of event listeners ensured there were no memory leaks.

              <h2> <span class="clng">Challenge:</span> Achieving Seamless 3D Effects in Staggered Image Animations
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Description:</strong>Creating a staggered animation for multiple images that fade in and out
                sequentially posed challenges in ensuring smooth transitions without overlap. Additionally, achieving a
                convincing 3D effect for the advertisement section required precise perspective manipulation and
                layering, aiming to simulate the illusion of girls emerging from the mobile screen to enhance user
                engagement effectively. <br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> To tackle this, I leveraged GSAP's timeline feature to animate the images
                using their references. This allowed me to orchestrate a staggered fade-in and fade-out sequence with
                precise control over timing and opacity, ensuring a smooth and repetitive animation cycle. Additionally,
                I applied CSS transformations like perspective, rotateY, and rotateX to the elements. The use of image
                references enhanced the depth of the 3D effect, making it appear as
                though the images were dynamically popping out of the screen, thus creating an engaging experience for
                users.
